Real-World Analogy: Honeypot is a Fake Shop
Imagine setting up a fake shop inside your house, designed to look real from the outside. You place attractive signs, open the door halfway, and even display fake items in the window.

Outsiders walking by ‚Äî especially those looking to steal ‚Äî see this and try to break in. But here‚Äôs the trick: the fake shop leads nowhere. It‚Äôs not connected to the rest of your home.

It‚Äôs just a setup to lure potential thieves, monitor what they do, and collect their methods ‚Äî all without putting your real home at risk.

That‚Äôs exactly how a honeypot works in cybersecurity. It looks like a vulnerable system to attackers, but it‚Äôs isolated from your real machines. While attackers believe they‚Äôre hacking something valuable, you‚Äôre actually recording their every move.

Launching a New Instance on ECE (Elastic Compute Environment)
To deploy the T-Pot honeypot safely on a cloud machine, I started by launching a new virtual instance using my ECE cloud panel.

Step-by-Step Instance Creation
11. Clicked on ‚ÄúLaunch Instance‚Äù
From the ECE dashboard, I clicked on the ‚ÄúLaunch Instance‚Äù button to begin creating a new virtual server.

![2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/97e32146-379a-42dc-bb25-ade075683f55)

2.Selected the Operating System: Ubuntu 
In the system configuration section, I chose Ubuntu as the operating system since T-Pot is 
designed to run on Ubuntu. 

![3](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/31ff1a37-e05f-4108-a70f-0abdeea71cfc)

3.Set the Storage Size to 128 GB 
I allocated 128 GB of disk space to ensure there is enough room for the honeypot tools, logs, 
and dashboards (like Kibana and ELK stack data). 

![4](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a3d33a27-c53c-453c-856d-5077e4595fc6)

4.Chose a IP Address 
I selected a my IP address for the instance so that it could be accessible over the internet ‚Äî 
allowing real-world attackers to reach the honeypot services exposed by T-Pot.v 

![5](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bcd61ee1-4b20-45c5-bc95-ffa19c828b47)

5.Generated a New SSH Key Pair 
I created a new key pair to securely access the virtual machine via SSH. This private key would 
be downloaded and used later for login.

![6](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/39f9f98e-bf18-4a86-964c-72b640479aba)

6.Selected the Instance Type: t3.XLarge Tier 
I picked the t3.XLarge instance type to provide sufficient CPU and memory resources for 
running multiple honeypots and dashboards smoothly. 
7. Reviewed the Configuration 
After verifying all the selected options (OS, tier, storage, key, and IP), I proceeded to launch the 
instance. 
8. Clicked ‚ÄúLaunch Instance‚Äù 
Finally, I clicked the ‚ÄúLaunch Instance‚Äù button to deploy the virtual machine. Within a few 
minutes, the instance was up and running, ready for SSH access and T-Pot installation.

![8](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a814daf7-d6e3-4085-98fe-04e41d4aed12)

After that go to the SSH client and copy the full command and go to the command prompt and 
terminal and paste it

![9](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/df98c9e5-d84e-4aae-bbbc-8360dae68780)


SSH Login Command to Access the Instance: 
ssh -i "your-key.pem" ubuntu@<Public-IP> 

![10](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d33809c6-6f3a-4d89-9f4f-70d11e0dbde6)

![11](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a58f9c2a-fbf2-4b02-b4b8-fd42134f4991)

After that run this command; 
Sudo apt update

![12](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/73992e6e-3030-48f7-8997-5201c71acb28)

Then I did  -- sudo apt update command

![13](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/46f1a0f6-e99b-4680-b234-fc4a004a1c20)

Once our system is updated then go to the this website and paste the github 
repositry https://github.com/telekom-security/tpotce and clone it 
https://github.com/telekom-security/tpotce.git

![14](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/68ccff44-e27f-4ab2-96e3-09cb2460787c)

after clone this repositry go the tpotce directory run this command 
./install.sh 
and click on y

![15](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/856adcce-dc93-4e05-b1ad-961260dab066)

select according to the image and set username and password for tpot

![16](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1ebf3b0a-a9da-468e-976b-de6661ddb862)

You can see here the tpot is successfully installed 
ignore sudo reboot now for now ...

Configuring Inbound Rules After T-Pot Installation 

Once the T-Pot honeypot was successfully installed on my Ubuntu server, the next crucial step 
was to configure inbound rules to allow external traffic to reach the services provided by T-Pot. 
This is done through the Security Group or firewall settings in the cloud panel (ECE in my case). 
Here‚Äôs how I set it up: go to the ec2 instance select security and click on according to the arrow 

![18](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b5f91a03-4d94-4551-b4bf-607d91038e10)

Why I Opened Ports 64295 and 64297 in AWS Inbound Rules

After successfully installing T-Pot honeypot on my Ubuntu EC2 instance, I had to 
configure inbound rules to allow traffic to specific ports used by T-Pot‚Äôs services and 
dashboards. Here‚Äôs why these particular ports were chosen: 
Purpose of Each Port 
o Port 64295 (TCP) ‚Üí This port is used by the T-Pot Web Cockpit (Admin UI). It 
provides an overview of the system status, uptime, and resource usage. It‚Äôs the 
main dashboard where I can monitor the honeypot‚Äôs performance and system 
health in real time. 
o Port 64297 (TCP) ‚Üí This port is dedicated to the Kibana Dashboard, which is 
part of the ELK stack integrated with T-Pot. It visualizes the captured logs and 
attack data, showing rich visual analytics about the threats interacting with the 
honeypots. 
These ports are not standard (like port 80 or 22), which makes them less predictable and slightly 
more secure by default. 
two times click on add rules

![19](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/db3c96e6-22f3-4491-a8bc-3558d028f9a7)

![20](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2a7ed9e8-f444-482d-b124-959ace29c3ac)

![21](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/214f5762-207b-4db3-9513-a26f0e9fdd32)

Logging In After Firewall Setup 
Once the inbound rules were saved, I connected to the T-Pot server via SSH using this 
command: 
ssh -i "keys2.pem" ubuntu@ec2-13-204-67-53.ap-south-1.compute.amazonaws.com -p 64295 
Breakdown: 
o i "keys2.pem" ‚Üí Path to the private key file for authentication 
o ubuntu@... ‚Üí Default user and public IP/domain of my EC2 instance 
o p 64295 ‚Üí Custom SSH port (T-Pot replaces the default port 22 with 64295 for 
added stealth) 

![22](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5ea85c6c-2c79-45d1-b2b4-b4bce744d737)

Go the ec2 instance and copy the ipv4 address and

![23](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b021211e-5de2-4b4b-8fe2-dfb8a139e08c)

run https://13.x.x.x:64297

![24](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2e8d766d-f8b6-4015-86ca-9334bebb848c)

After that login with username and password you created this before when we installing tpot

![25](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dcc6118d-c85b-4bf4-bde8-f6c7728316ba)

Real-Time Global Threat Monitoring via T-Pot Attack Map 
Once the honeypot was fully installed and the Kibana dashboard was accessible via port 64297, 
I opened the T-Pot Attack Map in the browser using the URL: 
https://<public-ip>:64297/map/ 
In my case: 
https://13.204.67.53:64297/map/ 
Note: You might see a security warning in the browser because T-Pot uses a self-signed 
certificate. You can proceed by clicking ‚ÄúAdvanced ‚Üí Proceed anyway.

![26](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0984dd20-3612-4382-bfa3-066f1c5a39ca)

What You See on the Attack Map 
The T-Pot Attack Map provides a real-time visual representation of all the attacks targeting the 
honeypot. Here‚Äôs what it shows: 
Your Honeypot‚Äôs Location 
As you can see in the image, the pink pin indicates my honeypot‚Äôs 
geolocation in India (13.204.67.53 hosted on ip-172-31-5-22). 
Top Hits by IP & Country 
The map displays live data about incoming attacks, including: 
o Source IP addresses

Top Suricata Signatures: 
o ET DROP Dshield Block Listed Source 
o ET INFO SSH session in progress 
o ET SCAN NMAP -sS 
o ET INFO Inbound HTTP CONNECT Attempt on Off-Port 
o These show attempts of Nmap scans, SSH brute force, and malicious HTTP 
traffic. 
Suricata CVEs: 
o No CVEs have been identified yet in the logs, meaning no known 
vulnerabilities have been exploited during these attacks (as of now). 
5. Attacker Information

![31](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c6f51b43-cb53-4855-b317-dc6b261c2c0a)

Geo-Map Insights (Visual Map): 
o The white and red lines on the map represent attack traces. 
o The animated paths (from Asia, Europe, and North America) reflect incoming 
intrusion attempts. 
o The magenta pin in India shows your server location (where T-Pot is running). 
o Arrows from USA, China, UK, and Germany show attackers scanning or 
interacting with your honeypot. 
Conclusion: Increased Attack Surface Visibility 
Compared to earlier, both the attack volume and targeted services have increased. 
The Cowrie honeypot is effectively detecting SSH and TELNET-based attacks. 
Attackers from multiple countries are interacting with the honeypot, which indicates that your 
server is publicly visible on the internet and is attracting bots and automated scanners. The 
Cowrie honeypot is effectively detecting SSH and TELNET-based attacks.
